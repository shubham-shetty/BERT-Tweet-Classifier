And even $400B probably wouldn’t have been enough to eliminate waitlists for home-based care in many states. The gap between demand/need and funding is just enormous.

I keep coming back to two basic, highly intertwined  problems: 1) we don't recognize the value of this care until it affects our own family; 2) we collectively refuse to pay for it. Families struggle, elders are vulnerable, workers are screwed.
