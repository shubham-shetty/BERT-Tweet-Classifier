2021-10-27 22:15:58+00:00,1453485653505814528,I actually would be surprised if Trump went to Virgina before the election. The odds are still in McAuliffeâ€™s favor and itâ€™s be easy to blame Trump for Youngkinâ€™s loss. Trump can blame Youngkin for not having Trump campaign if Trump doesnâ€™t show up and McAuliffe wins.
