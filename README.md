# BERT Tweet Classifier

This project provides a way to scrape tweets based on a query or username using the Tweepy API, and then classify annotated data using BERT. This was developed to collect political tweets and then classify them as 'MALE' or 'FEMALE' using BERT for CS685 coursework.  

`scraping_utils` and `tweet_extractor.ipynb` provide code to extract tweets using the Tweepy API, and `BERT_classifier` folder contains notebook to classify tweets and also the final annotated data.
